scpf (1.1.19) stable; urgency=medium

  * Initial open source release.
  * Version 1.1.19

    * Fix rebar.config.lock, which had older versions of apns_erl and sc_push
      repositories. The only functional difference is that sc_push now does
      asynchronous pushes; other changes involve documentation and cleanup.
