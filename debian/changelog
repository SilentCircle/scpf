scpf (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Version 2.0.2

    * Fix APNS HTTP/2 500 errors due to idle session or expired token.

      APNS was returning 500 Internal Server Error for no apparent reason. On
      investigation it appears to be due to a session that has been idle for
      too long, or possibly because the APNS auth token (JWT) has expired.

      This commit adds the following behaviors:

      1. The session sends an HTTP/2 PING frame periodically (default: 5
         minutes).
      2. Whenever it sends a notification, the session first checks that the
         APNS authentication JWT is newer - based on its 'Issued At (`iat`)
         field - than a configurable value (default: 55 minutes). If it is not
         newer, the session generates a new JWT.

scpf (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Version 2.0.0

    * Add support for APNS HTTP/2.
    * Add support for Sentry.
    * Add some library support for JWT, but it's not ready for use with
      APNS HTTP/2. That will come in a future release.
    * Deprecate old APNS session (apns_erl) in favor of apns_erlv3.
      apns_erl (binary APNS interface) probably doesn't even work any more.
    * Add genuine async push support (not just cast to gen_xxx).
    * Do major refactoring.
    * Redo most test cases to use new APNS and improved GCM simulators.
    * Change APIs (breaking changes for push).
    * Add and update significant amount of documentation.
    * Make ready for open source by adding headers, copyrights, and licences.
      Remove, change, or sanitize SC-specific information and references.
    * Move repositories to public github.
